This project implements a simple machine learning model to predict student results based on study hours, attendance, and marks. The model uses a Decision Tree classifier to determine if a student passes or fails.

Data:-
The dataset used in this project consists of the following features:
 Number of hours a student studied,
 Percentage of attendance,
 Marks obtained by the student.
The target variable is result, which indicates whether a student passes (1) or fails (0).

Model:-
The model used for prediction is a Decision Tree classifier from the scikit-learn library. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and the model is evaluated based on accuracy.

Results:-
The output of the model includes,
Predictions of student results
Actual results from the test set.
Accuracy percentage of the predictions.
